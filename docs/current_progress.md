# Current Progress

## Planning Phase: Complete
- Created detailed development plan with small, manageable steps
- Defined task tracker with actionable tasks
- Designed database schema for KPI data storage
- Outlined agent architecture using PydanticAI framework
- Created approach for test data generation

## Implementation Phase: In Progress
- [x] Task 1.1: Created project structure and initialized FastAPI app
  - Set up basic FastAPI application with configuration
  - Created project directory structure
  - Set up API endpoints structure
  - Added authentication using API key
  - Prepared database connection module
- [x] Task 1.2: Set up PostgreSQL connection and config
  - Created database models from schema design
  - Implemented database connector class
  - Added database setup and check scripts
  - Created table relationships and indexes

## Next Steps
- Task 1.3: Implement database schema in PostgreSQL
- Task 1.4: Create migration scripts
- Task 1.5: Create data generation script
- Task 1.6: Begin agent implementation starting with Query Interpreter Agent

## Technical Decisions
- Using PydanticAI for agent framework
- Using FastAPI for backend API development
- Using PostgreSQL for data storage
- Using SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interactions
- Using statistical and time series analysis for KPI data
- Simple approach first, with plans to scale later
